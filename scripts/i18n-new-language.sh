Next:
  1. Translate the right-hand column of $dest.
  2. In crates/app/src/i18n.rs add to LANGUAGES (choose the Plural:: rule of the language, see docs/translating.md):
       Language { code: "$code", name: "$name", tables: &[include_str!("../locales/$code.tsv")], plural: Plural::OneOther,
                  case: crate::textcase::CaseLocale::Invariant, status: Status::Partial },
     and add "$code" to SETTING_CHOICES.
  3. Add a row to the table in docs/translating.md, run UPDATE_DOCS=1 cargo test -p app docs_reference,
     then cargo test -p app --bin codeyard i18n and scripts/i18n-status.sh.
